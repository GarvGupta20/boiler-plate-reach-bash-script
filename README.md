# boiler-plate-reach-bash-script
creating a ready to do project directory with most used dependencies seems tougher with various commands and changes that need configuration
hence this is a bash file that is read to go that tackles all the headache with on command

using this script : to use this script simply write the comamnd '. createreact.sh'

this uses :

1.prettier
2.eslint 
3. configuring both of them and making them work togeather
4. all necessary dependencies 
5. use vite to bundle code and scripts for deployable application



if you want more dependencies to be default you can make chnages to the script simply in the npm install line 

and if you know little bit of simple bash commands and you customize it to your need
